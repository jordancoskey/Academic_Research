Sorting Research Paper: A comparative research of 4 common sorting algorithms under different data sets.


This report tests and analyses the performance of 4 specific sorting algorithms namely Insertion sort,                                    Recursive insertion sort, Double insertion sort and Bucket sort. The testing and determination of the                                      best sorting algorithm in its respective environment will be done with 5 different array sizes ranging                                    from small to large all with the assumption that all data types will be of type Integer and only                                          aescending order is desired.
